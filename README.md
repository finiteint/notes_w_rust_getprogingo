# Notes on Get Prog in Go with Rust

Apologies to anyone who stumbled on this. Please ignore this and
keep moving. 

This is just some notes in the form of some rust projects with
some random code made while working through _Get Programming in
Go_ (examples and exercises). The code is in Rust because I was
curious how equivalent things are done in Rust. This is not 
meant to be useful in any way.

It is split by units, but not organized or structured in any way.
It is neither complete nor correct.



* [Unit 1](./u01/)
* [Unit 2](./u02/)
* [Unit 3](./u03/)
* [Unit 4](./u04/)
* [Unit 5](./u05/)
* [Unit 6](./u06/)
* [Unit 7](./u07/)
